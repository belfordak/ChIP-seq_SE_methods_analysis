# ChIP-seq_SE_methods_analysis
Here I investigated ChIP-seq methods in calling high quality super-enhancer regions, with variable acetylation, transcription factors, and peak calling methodologies. The genes associated with these regions (proximity) were mapped to expression data to observe functional significance - via fpkm, fold change, cell type specificity and intron/exon ratio.
